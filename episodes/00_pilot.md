# ASPICE Literacy: Driving Quality Before Driving Cars 🏁  
**By Abdul Osman**  

---

Before a car ever hits the road, its software travels a long and complex journey.

This journey of systems engineering involves multiple stakeholders — not just the OEM, but also Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, consulting firms, and engineering service providers.

Cooperation flows across organizational borders, each player bringing their own strategies, priorities, and definitions of “quality”.

In this cross-company relay, alignment becomes more than a management buzzword — it’s a daily challenge.

And in the automotive world, one framework keeps that journey safe, consistent, and predictable: **Automotive SPICE (ASPICE).**

With this new series — **ASPICE Literacy** — I’ll break down the standard into clear, practical insights.  
No jargon overload.  
No death-by-PDF.  
No 120-slide PPT nightmares.

## 📌 Why This Series?

After many years in automotive software, I’ve observed a few recurring patterns that can’t be ignored.

### 1️⃣ High Team Turnover = Process Amnesia

The automotive world sees **high fluctuation in teams** — job changes, reorganizations, economic turbulence.

Knowledge walks out the door.

Without established, consistent processes, every newcomer risks **reinventing the wheel**, slowing down delivery and degrading quality.

### 2️⃣ Education? Too Rare, Too Late

Standards like **ASPICE, ISO 26262, ISO 9001, ISTQB** are rarely taught proactively.

- Training costs money.  
- Training costs production hours.  
- Teams are permanently under pressure.

So most people learn:
- too late,  
- too shallowly,  
- or in their free time.

After a 9–10 hour day (plus commute), few have the energy for self-study — deep knowledge remains the exception.

### 3️⃣ Myths Multiply in the Dark

Where education is lacking, **myths grow fast**:

- “ASPICE is just documentation.”  
- “Maturity Level 3 means more templates.”  
- “Testing alone will get us ASPICE compliant.”

These misconceptions make real process improvement harder.

When misinformation spreads, **management buy-in collapses**, and even motivated engineers resist learning — because myths poison the mind *before* the first lesson begins.

### 4️⃣ The Rise of the ‘Magic Elixir’ Consultant

Too often, ASPICE consulting becomes **modern-day charlatanism**.

A consultant arrives, sells a “shortcut to ASPICE”, delivers a glossy report… and disappears.

Weeks later, the team realizes:
- there is **no magic elixir**,  
- no shortcut exists,  
- and maturity cannot be bought.

When reality strikes, people jump ship, roles change, knowledge scatters, and the cycle repeats — ready for the next round of snake oil.

## 🎯 The Goal of ASPICE Literacy

This series exists to strip away:
- myths,  
- guesswork,  
- and snake oil…

… and replace them with **practical, context-driven understanding** of ASPICE.

We’ll explore:

- 🔍 What ASPICE really *is* (and isn’t)  
- 🛠️ How it impacts day-to-day engineering  
- 📈 Why it’s more than compliance — it’s a competitive advantage  
- 💡 How to approach ASPICE without slowing down innovation  

Whether you’re a developer, tester, project manager, auditor, or simply *ASPICE-curious* — this series will help you **drive quality before driving cars**.

Because in the end, *quality is built by people who understand the road they’re driving on.*
